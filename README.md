Basic National Park & Mountain exploration website Website

The home page features a parallax mountain web effect that tracks the users mouse positions using simple javascript logic.
The images on the bottom function as a carousel that link users to the Mountain information and National Parks pages

When a user selects options in either dropdown bar, the javascript then filters the results and populates bootstrap cards with the reqiested information. The "visit" button functions as a link to an information page
